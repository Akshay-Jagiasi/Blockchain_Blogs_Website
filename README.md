# Blockchain_Blogs_Website

In this Blockchain_blogs web project, I gained a deeper understanding and familiarity with the use of Node.js, Express, and multi-page web applications. I also learned more about using EJS, a JavaScript templating language, to generate dynamic HTML pages, as well as using JavaScript and Mongoose to connect to and interact with a MongoDB database. These technologies and techniques were integral to the development and functionality of the web project, and through working on it, I was able to improve my skills and knowledge in these areas.
